We want to know your business goals, what is\r\n              important to your users and your design preferences. We look at\r\n              what your competitors are doing. We find out what sets you apart\r\n              from the crowd. We take all of this information, add inspiration,\r\n              creativity and marketing strategies to create custom designs that\r\n              inspire users to act.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"content2Head font-weight-bold text-dark mt-3\">\r\n              THE PROCESS\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className=\"heading\">\r\n              <div className=\"circle\">\r\n                <img\r\n                  src=\"https://www.infront.com/images/default-source/2018-assets/website-design.png?sfvrsn=20c42ee_6\"\r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                  width=\"100%\"\r\n                />\r\n              </div>\r\n              <p className=\"contentPara font-weight-bold mt-3\">\r\n                Phase One: Design of the Home Page\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"contentPara\">\r\n              During this part of the process the design team collaborates and\r\n              brainstorms the ideas for the design of your new site. We will\r\n              review the questionnaire you provided and the notes from our\r\n              kickoff meeting. We will then go to work on creating a mock-up of\r\n              our vision of your home page. The home page is the first\r\n              impression for your visitors, so it is very important that the\r\n              designers take their time to evaluate the best way to present the\r\n              most important elements. Once we have created a design that we\r\n              believe meets your needs we will schedule a time to review the\r\n              design with you. At this point you will have the opportunity to\r\n              evaluate the design and discuss with us any potential changes.\r\n              Keep in mind we will not move onto the interior design until you\r\n              are completely satisfied with the home page design.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className=\"heading\">\r\n              <div className=\"circle\">\r\n                <img\r\n                  src=\"https://www.infront.com/images/default-source/2018-assets/website-design.png?sfvrsn=20c42ee_6\"\r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                  width=\"100%\"\r\n                />\r\n              </div>\r\n              <p className=\"contentPara font-weight-bold mt-3\">\r\n                Phase Two: Design of the Interior Pages\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"contentPara\">\r\n              The design team works on a design to be used on the interior pages\r\n              of your site. This step in the process is typically faster since\r\n              the bulk of the creativity is used to create the home page. It is,\r\n              nonetheless, a different design and depending on the complexity of\r\n              the site itself it is difficult to determine an exact timeline.\r\n              Again, once we have created a design that we believe illustrates\r\n              and identifies your needs we will schedule a time to review. As we\r\n              did with the home page design you will also have the opportunity\r\n              to evaluate and discuss with us any potential changes. Once you\r\n              have approved both the home page and interior we will move into\r\n              phase three: Development.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className=\"heading\">\r\n              <div className=\"circle\">\r\n                <img\r\n                  src=\"https://www.infront.com/images/default-source/2018-assets/website-design.png?sfvrsn=20c42ee_6\"\r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                  width=\"100%\"\r\n                />\r\n              </div>\r\n              <p className=\"contentPara font-weight-bold mt-3\">\r\n                Phase Three: Development\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"contentPara\">\r\n              During this process the team works to translate the design into\r\n              html code and install it on a live development server. Depending\r\n              on the complexity of the design of your site, this part of the\r\n              process can be lengthy. If your site has custom functionality or\r\n              coding that will also impact the timeline. As soon as we have the\r\n              code written and installed on our development server we can begin\r\n              to load content. During the Development phase it is the perfect\r\n              time for you to organize your content so we can get it loaded as\r\n              soon as it is ready. Be sure to provide the content for each page,\r\n              and all necessary images and/or files.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className=\"orangeDiv\">\r\n              <p className=\"orangeHeading\">Looking for more info?</p>\r\n              <p className=\"contentPara orangePara\">\r\n                Try our portfolio page, where you can see a small sample of the\r\n                hundreds of sites we've built.

One of the company's first projects\r\n              was a simple website that indexed agricultural research documents\r\n              and made them available to U.S. Department of Agriculture field\r\n              agents through the world wide web.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"contentPara\">\r\n              From the humble beginnings of this simple website, this Colorado\r\n              Springs website design company grew to a team specialized in\r\n              creating cost effective data driven websites. In 1999, Andy bought\r\n              the assets of DMA and Timberline Webworks was born. Timberline\r\n              grew during the dot-com boom and became Infront Webworks in 2000.\r\n              Despite the negative economic effects post-9/11/2001, Infront\r\n              Webworks thrived and began to hone its areas of expertise in:\r\n              website architecture, web design, graphic design, online marketing\r\n              strategy, web development, SEO or search engine optimization,\r\n              digital marketing & cloud services.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"contentPara\">\r\n              In April of 2012, Infront's reins were handed over to its new CEO\r\n              and owner Matthew Palis, an Internet veteran with more than 20\r\n              years experience in running web development, SEO, online marketing\r\n              or internet marketing, creative design, and cloud services\r\n              companies. In June 2013, Infront moved \"uptown\" in Colorado\r\n              Springs and continues to serve its worldwide client base from an\r\n              office designed to promote collaboration amongst
