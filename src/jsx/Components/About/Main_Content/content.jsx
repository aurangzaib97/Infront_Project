            <p className="contentPara font-weight-bold">Our Story</p>
            <p className="contentPara">
              Infront's seeds were planted when Andy Meng moved to Colorado
              Springs in October 1994 to found a company called Data Made
              Accessible with his brother. One of the company's first projects
              was a simple website that indexed agricultural research documents
              and made them available to U.S. Department of Agriculture field
              agents through the world wide web.
            </p>
            <p className="contentPara">
              From the humble beginnings of this simple website, this Colorado
              Springs website design company grew to a team specialized in
              creating data driven websites. In 1999, Andy bought the assets of
              DMA and Timberline Webworks was born. Timberline grew during the
              dot-com boom and became Infront Webworks in 2000. Despite the
              negative economic effects post-9/11/2001, Infront Webworks thrived
              and began to hone its areas of expertise in: website architecture,
              web design, development, SEO, marketing & cloud services.
            </p>
            <p className="contentPara">
              In April of 2012, Infront's reins were handed over to its new CEO
              and owner Matthew Palis, an Internet veteran with more than 20
              years of experience in running web development, SEO, online
              marketing, and cloud services companies. In June 2013, Infront
              moved "uptown" in Colorado Springs and continues to serve its
              worldwide client base from an office designed to promote
              collaboration amongst team members and clients.
