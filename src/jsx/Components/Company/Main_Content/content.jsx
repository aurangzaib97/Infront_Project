              Most successful businesses and organizations in competitive
              markets have found that creating a legitimate presence on the
              internet is one of the most valuable efforts they can undertake to
              drive new business and serve existing customers & partners. There
              are many ways to market online, but for most companies, a website
              is the cornerstone of successful marketing as it’s the company’s
              24x7 "office."" There are three essential characteristics of a
              successful website: credibility (how it looks), usability (how it
              works), and findability (how it’s found). Infront Webworks works
              closely with you to build a website that achieves an optimal
              balance between these three characteristics, tailored for your
              online strategy.

            <p className="contentPara">
              Infront's seeds were planted when Andy Meng moved to Colorado
              Springs in October 1994 to found a company called Data Made
              Accessible with his brother. One of the company's first projects
              was a simple website that indexed agricultural research documents
              and made them available to U.S. Department of Agriculture field
              agents through the world wide web.
            </p>
            <p className="contentPara">
              From the humble beginnings of this simple website, this Colorado
              Springs website design company grew to a team specialized in
              creating cost effective data driven websites. In 1999, Andy bought
              the assets of DMA and Timberline Webworks was born. Timberline
              grew during the dot-com boom and became Infront Webworks in 2000.
              Despite the negative economic effects post-9/11/2001, Infront
              Webworks thrived and began to hone its areas of expertise in:
              website architecture, web design, graphic design, online marketing
              strategy, web development, SEO or search engine optimization,
              digital marketing & cloud services.
            </p>
            <p className="contentPara">
              In April of 2012, Infront's reins were handed over to its new CEO
              and owner Matthew Palis, an Internet veteran with more than 20
              years experience in running web development, SEO, online marketing
              or internet marketing, creative design, and cloud services
              companies. In June 2013, Infront moved "uptown" in Colorado
              Springs and continues to serve its worldwide client base from an
              office designed to promote collaboration amongst team members and
              clients.
