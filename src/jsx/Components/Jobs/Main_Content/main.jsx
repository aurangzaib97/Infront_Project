            Much of our inspiration and motivation comes from the beauty and
            majesty of the place where we live and work: the foothills of the
            Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, in the very shadow of Pikes
            Peak. When we aren't busy doing digital marketing or building
            websites, chances are we are in the surrounding mountains recharging
            our creative batteries and putting things in their proper
            perspective.
