            Personally identifiable information is stored on a vetted
            third-party vendors’ servers and is not publicly accessible.
            Further, personally identifiable information is only accessed by

            ANONYMOUS INFORMATION COLLECTED BY INFRONT WEBWORKS

          <p className="main1Para">
            Anonymous information is automatically collected for every donor and

            browser type, age, gender, language, country, and city. This

            are visiting our websites, as well as, the effectiveness of our
            websites, individual sections, and pages within them. IP numbers are
            not stored but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in
            some cases, geographic region. We do not make any association
            between this information and a donor or visitor's identity.

            HOW THE INFRONT WEBWORKS WEBSITE USES COOKIES
          </p>
          <p className="main1Para">
            As with most other Internet sites, our web servers utilize “cookies”
            to track a user’s activity within our websites as well as record the
            IP address of each visitor to our websites. A cookie is a small data
            file that is stored on your computer. A cookie contains a unique
            identifying feature that allows our servers to recognize you when
            you return to INFRONT WEBWORKS websites. The recorded IP address
            tells us which domain you visited from (for instance, Google.com,
            Facebook.com, etc.), but not your email address or other private and
            personally identifiable information. We use the information we
            record to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our
            websites more effectively, and to gather broad demographic
            information about what countries and domains our visitors come from,
            and their behavior on our websites.

          <p className="main1Para">
            INFRONT WEBWORKS uses Google Analytics to collect information about
            the use of our websites. Google Analytics collects information such
            as how often users visit these websites, what pages they visit when
            they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our
            websites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to
            you on the date you visit our websites, rather than your name or
            other identifying information. We do not combine the information
            collected using Google Analytics with personally identifiable
            information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on
            your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you
            visit our websites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
            Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google
            Analytics about your visits to our websites is restricted by the
            Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can
            prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to
            our websites by disabling cookies on your web browser.
